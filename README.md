Intelligent University Inquiry Chatbot<br>

# ABSTRACT

We have developed Intelligent University Inquiry Chatbot to makes ease the work of users by this Intelligent Chatbot. A lot of time is spent, and much effort is made for finding relevant details of admission and other information like fee structure of different department and members of faculty. With the help of this chatbot, a user can find details of different departments of the university. A chatbot can also be described as a program that is able to communicate with people using artificial intelligence. This software is used to perform tasks such as to inform the user promptly, to help them to buy the courses, and to provide a better service to the students or guests. A chatbot can be used anywhere a human is interacting with a computer system. The most well-known chatbots currently are voice chatbots: Alexa and Siri. However, chatbots are currently being adopted at a high rate on computer chat platforms.

With this chatbot, users can get the information available on the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad website. Users also can download forms regarding admissions, scholarships, and jobs. They can ask the chatbot to provide links to their desired pages. They can check their attendance on the online attendance system as well as on the learning management system.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

# 1.1 Background

Automation technologies are taking over all the spheres of our lives, be it the development of smart cities, smart homes, automated workspaces or technologies like smartphones and digital personal assistants. With every new development, we are moving a step closer to a more connected and digital future. Chatbots are being made to ease the pain that the industries are facing today. It could live in any major chat applications like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc. There is a need of 24/7 support for customers and other Business. A chat interface allows chatbots to converse with users. The purpose of chatbots is to support and scale business teams in their relations with customers. We are only scratching the surface of what a chatbot-enabled future may look like.

# 1.2 Description

We daily go through a lot of cases either in a university or in any Educational Institute. And in some of these cases, situation could be worst. Statics shows that hundreds of thousands of students do not get enough information related to their queries even in the most developed university or educational institute around the world.
As described below:  
Germany => 1,00,000  
Australia => 20,000 US => 4,60,000  
India => 96,000  
Russia => 45,000
Social media plays a vital role to guide the students to get their desired Information. But it is limited to cover a small knowledge area and has a very limited scope. Specifically, in Pakistan, we use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube etc. of different educational institute to get desire information. No doubt, these traditional methods are useful too, but a central system just for this dedicated cause would have proven to be more fruitful, which unfortunately not well known and do not have much scope.
A chatbot is programmed to work independently from a human operator. It can answer questions formulated to it in natural language and respond like a real person. It provides responses based on a combination of predefined scripts and machine learning applications. Chatbot is typically perceived as engaging software entity which humans can talk to. It can be interesting, inspiring, and intriguing. It appears everywhere, from old ancient HTML pages to modern advanced social networking.

# 1.3 Problem Statement:

A lot of people use in their efforts to find the information for themselves. Their time is being wasted, and they have not been successful in finding the platform, either. They are going to search for it directly because they will know its exact location. Application to a web chatbot project is to purchase an item, as there is with it, or to answer any specific questions. Social media plays a vital role to guide the students to get their desired Information. But it is limited to cover a small knowledge area and has a very limited scope. Specifically, in Pakistan, we use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube etc. of different educational institute to get desire information.

# 1.4 Scope

It is hard to find out a specific detail in a large social community present over the world. Many of people are not utilize their effort to find out desire information. So, in this way their time got wasted and not get success to find the platform. They cannot search it directly because they do not know their exact location. The proposed solution is a project of a Web-based Chatbot, to get the desired details just by talking to it or answering some specific questions. The chatbot can access the details of university or educational institute website and can show those details to students if he asked for them. If chatbot does not find the details for the student inquiries. The Chatbot will sent those queries to admin via mail. So, admin will assist student regarding those inquires and they contact each other by their mail information and ultimately, they get students get their desired information by chatbot.

# 1.5 Objectives

The main objective of this project is people/students can find their desired details. It will provide facility to the finder. Finder can easily find the desired information.  
• Goal (broader): Students/relative find their desired details easily by just talking about problem or by giving some simple answer to questions, some details to help in today’s world. It will provide a single platform to find i.e., University or Educational institute Website.
• Objective (more specific): Help Students.
• Objective (more specific): Help those students who are in search of specific information.  
• Objective (more specific): Help those students who are in search of admission.  
• Objective (more specific): It should provide a platform for those who are searching for specific information regarding there confusion.

# 1.6 Feasibility:

The project we are going to build is easy to talk and fast way to get desire information. As it does not require more than 1 person to talk about the details. Every User will perform his/her actions himself.
1.6.1 Technical Feasibility –
Technical resources being used in the project are easy to use and cheap to use.
1.6.2 Schedule Feasibility –
All the necessary resources are available. Project will be complete by the given deadline.
1.6.3 Economic Feasibility –
As project is going to be developed by a small team and all the resources being used are cheap. So, the project is economically feasible.
1.6.4 Cultural Feasibility –
Most of the people in cities have access to Internet. So, the system is implementable.
1.6.5 Legal/Ethical Feasibility –
There is no legal or ethical restriction in making this system.
1.6.6 Resource Feasibility –
Yes, user has enough resources to back the development of this system.
1.6.7 Operational Feasibility –
There are tons of help on internet about every difficulty we feel on the course of development. So, I hope, this will be easy to build this project.

# 1.7 REQUIREMENTS

# 1.7.1 Functional Requirements

Any requirement which precisely specifies what the system should do is called functional requirement of the system. In other words, a functional requirement will describe a particular behavior of function of the system when certain conditions are met, for example: “Send email when a new customer signs up” or “Open a new account”.

# 1.8 Stakeholders:

Project stakeholders are entities that have an interest in each project. These stakeholders may be inside or outside an organization which:

1. Sponsor a project, or
2. Have an interest or a gain upon a successful completion of a project.
3. May have a positive or negative influence in the project completion.
   We need to understand that it is the actual user who will eventually use the system and hence accept or reject the product. Therefore, ignoring the needs of any user class may result in the system failure
